# CP1A - Office Space Allocation (AMITY)

A project done in fulfillment of the first checkpoint of the Andela training program.

#1. Problem definition / statement.

The main objective of this project is to model a room allocation system for one of Andelaâ€™s facilities called Amity.

**Who? Fellows and staff at one of Andela's facilities alias Amity.**

Fellows and staff at Andela's Amity facility are the immediate consumers of the system.

**What? A room allocation system**

The goal is to model and build a room allocation system that smoothens the problem of keeping track of office ad living spaces at Amity, providing a scalable and usable solution.

>An office can occupy a maximum of 6 people. A living space can inhabit a maximum of 4 people.

**Where? Office spaces and living spaces.**

The system manages office spaces as well as living spaces and ensures they are allocated effectively.

**When? On request to occupy a space.**

The spaces mentioned above need to be allocated when vacant or occupied and/or reallocated as well as give status on their status when required.
The system serves to also tell how many people are in a given space at any given time.

**Why? To ensure smooth and seamless allocation and transfer of rooms amongst fellow and staff.**

The criteria set to solve the problem is to ensure the rooms can and will be allocated on request to get a new space whether office space or living space.
There is also the need to have a way of determing how many people are at a particular space from time to time.
