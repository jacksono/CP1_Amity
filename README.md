# CP1A - Office Space Allocation (AMITY)

>Check point One project at Andela as part of the training program

1.Project definition.**

The project models a room allocation system for one of Andelaâ€™s facilities called Amity.

**Who?**

Fellows and Staff at Andela's Amity facility are the immediate consumers of the system.

**What?**

Offices and Living spaces are created and can be allocated to Staff and Fellows in Amity

>An office can occupy a maximum of 6 people. A living space can inhabit a maximum of 4 people.

**When? On request to occupy a space.**

A new Fellow or Staff member added to Amity is automatically assigned a room ( office and living space as applicable). If there are no available rooms at the time the person is being created then they can be allocated later after a new room is created or becomes available.

**Why?**
To optimize room allocations in Amity and keep track of the same. The people not having rooms are also tracked and can be reallocated to room.
